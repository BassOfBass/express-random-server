            In our first ARIA task, we present you with a section of non-semantic markup, which is obviously meant to be a list. Assuming you are not able to change the elements used, how can you allow screenreader users to recognize this as a list?

      section#listaria
        p My favorite animals:
        div(role="list")
          div(role="listitem", aria-posinset="1", aria-setsize="5") Pig
          div(role="listitem", aria-posinset="2", aria-setsize="5") Gazelle
          div(role="listitem", aria-posinset="3", aria-setsize="5") Llama

          p.
            In our second WAI-ARIA task, we present a simple search form, and we want you to add in a couple of WAI-ARIA features to improve its accessibility:

          ol
            li.
              How can you allow the search form to be called out as a separate landmark on the page by screenreaders, to make it easily findable?
            li.
              How can you give the search input a suitable label, without explicitly adding a visible text label to the DOM?
      section
        form(role="search")
          input(type="search", name="search", aria-label="Search through site content")

          p.
            For this final WAI-ARIA task, we return to an example we previously saw in the #[a(href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript/Test_your_skills:_CSS_and_JavaScript_accessibility") CSS and JavaScript skilltest]. As before, we have a simple app that presents a list of animal names. Clicking one of the animal names causes a further description of that animal to appear in a box below the list. Here, we are starting with a mouse- and keyboard-accessible version.

          p.
            The problem we have now is that when the DOM changes to show a new decription, screenreaders cannot see what has changed. Can you update it so that description changes are annouced by the screenreader?
      section#animalsaria.preview
        div.animallist
          h1 Animal summaries
          p The following list of animals can be clicked to display a description of that animal.
          ul
            li(tabindex="0", data-description="A type of wild mountain goat, with large recurved horns, found in Eurasia, North Africa, and East Africa.") Ibex
            li(tabindex="0", data-description="A medium-sized manrine mammal, similar to a manatee, but with a Dolphin-like tail.") Dugong
            li(tabindex="0", data-description="A rare marsupial, which looks rather like a tiny kangaroo, measuring around 50 to 75 centimeters.") Quokka
        
        div.animaldescription(aria-live="assertive", aria-relevant="all", aria-atomic="true")
